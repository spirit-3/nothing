         <h2>Prudence Group of Schools are English medium, co-educational Schools affiliated to Central Board of School Education (CBSE). It has within a very short period of time established as one of the most prestigious upcoming schools in Delhi and NCR, pioneering a new paradigm of excellence in school education through a learner-centred educational system aimed at providing developmentally appropriate programmes to encourage not just learning but also the love of learning. The entire establishment works with the sole objective of providing wholesome education to every child by incorporating the best possible physical, intellectual, moral, spiritual and cultural learning. It provides an environment that is safe, clean, healthy and child oriented. Here with the help of our dynamic curriculum, opportunities are created and abilities developed so that the children who come to our fold are truly educated and enriched and empowered to innovate and create.

Our schools are nurturing places where everyone - teachers, students, management and also the parents feel equally responsible to grow together as a team and attain greater heights. Here each of the team members feel supported, cared for and respected. Teachers are all very creative persons, needing the freedom and opportunity to discover their own hidden depths, which flower and blossom, given a positive climate. Here we try and create an environment that nurtures the creativity and growth of not just our students but our teachers too. We believe a coordinated effort is needed among the students, teachers and the parents to ensure we get all positive outcomes.
